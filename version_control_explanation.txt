Version control means to me a systematic way to track changes in my code over time. 
It's like having a time machine for my projects - I can see what I changed, when I changed it, 
and why I made those changes. If I make a mistake, I can easily revert back to a working version. 
It also enables collaboration by allowing multiple people to work on the same project without 
overwriting each other's work. Git specifically helps me maintain a clean project history and 
manage different features through branching.


Added stress mood and self-care activity.
